Template from standards/release-prep-and-cut @ v1.0.0
(crzynet/homelab-configs/standards/release-prep-and-cut/README.md).

Placeholders are RESOLVED for this project (octoprint-filament-db-plugin).
Values below are the live ones -- do not re-parameterise them.

  <VERSION_FILE>             octoprint_filamentdb/_version.py
                             Single source of truth. pyproject.toml reads it via
                             [tool.setuptools.dynamic]; __init__.py reads it for
                             __plugin_version__. Neither declares its own copy, so
                             this file is the ONLY place the number changes.

  <VERSION_LITERAL>          __version__ = "<current>"

  <README_BADGE_PATTERN>     (none -- the README carries CI/CodeQL status badges,
                             not a version badge. Skip this step; do not invent one.)

  <README_WHATSNEW_SECTION>  (none -- CHANGELOG.md is the single source of release
                             notes and the README links to it. Do NOT duplicate
                             release notes into the README.)

  <DOCS_TO_SYNC>             - CHANGELOG.md   roll [Unreleased] into the new version

                             of these and they must all pass before opening the PR:

                                                    node must be present or it FAILS,
                                                    by design -- it must not skip)

                             locally one interpreter is acceptable, but a release that
                             changes syntax or stdlib use must be checked against 3.9.

  PROJECT-SPECIFIC RULE -- READ THIS:
  This command NEVER merges the PR. It prepares, pushes, and opens the PR, then
  STOPS. Merging to main is the user's gate (see CLAUDE.md). /release-cut runs
  only after the user has merged and main CI is green.

# Release Prep

You are preparing release **v$ARGUMENTS**. This command does ONLY the prep + PR
steps. It does **not** merge and does **not** create the GitHub release — the
human merges, and `/release-cut` (run after `main` CI is green) creates the
release.

## Execution rules

- Work on the `dev` branch. Never push directly to `main`.
- Do NOT add `Co-authored-by` lines to the commit.
- Do NOT create the GitHub release or tag in this command.
- If any validation step fails, STOP and report — do not commit broken state.
- Make exactly ONE commit covering version + changelog + all doc updates.
- `$ARGUMENTS` is the target version. It SHOULD be bare semver, no `v` prefix
  (e.g. `0.3.6`). If a leading `v` was typed (`v0.3.6`), strip it silently and
  proceed with the bare number. After stripping, if the value is empty or does
  not match `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` exactly (three integers, dot-separated, no
  pre-release/build suffix), STOP and ask for a valid version.
- Reminder on the `v` convention: the version is stored and used BARE
  everywhere (`octoprint_filamentdb/_version.py`, changelog header, README badge, in-code image
  tags). The `v` prefix is added in exactly one place — the git tag / GitHub
  release — and that happens in `/release-cut`, not here.

## Step 0 — Preflight

1. Confirm the current branch is `dev`. If not, STOP and report.
2. Confirm the working tree is clean (`git status --porcelain` empty). If
   there are uncommitted changes, STOP and show them — the user must decide.
3. Read the current version from `octoprint_filamentdb/_version.py`. Parse both the current
   version and `$ARGUMENTS` into `(MAJOR, MINOR, PATCH)` integer triples for
   comparison.

### 0a — Hard stops (never proceed past these)

- **Not newer.** If `$ARGUMENTS` is not strictly greater than the current
  version (compared as integer triples, not string compare), STOP and report.
  This blocks re-running an already-shipped version, going backward, or a typo
  that lands on an old number. Equal-to-current also stops.
- **Tag already exists.** Run `git fetch --tags` then check both
  `git tag -l "v$ARGUMENTS"` and `gh release view "v$ARGUMENTS"`. If either
  exists, STOP and report — the release already exists and must not be
  clobbered.

### 0b — Bump-tier classification (warn + confirm)

Classify the jump from current → target. Only a clean single-patch bump
proceeds silently; everything else pauses for explicit confirmation.

- **Patch bump** = MAJOR and MINOR unchanged, PATCH increased.
  - If PATCH increased by exactly 1 (e.g. `0.3.3` → `0.3.4`): proceed, no
    prompt.
  - If PATCH skipped ahead (e.g. `0.3.3` → `0.3.7`): WARN that N patch
    versions were skipped, show the expected next patch (current with
    PATCH+1), and require explicit confirmation before proceeding.

- **Minor bump** = MINOR increased (MAJOR unchanged), e.g. `0.3.3` → `0.4.0`.
  ALWAYS warn and require confirmation, even for the clean `.0` case. Message:
  this is a **new minor release**, which is infrequent — confirm it's
  intended. Note that a new minor also fires the changelog archive trigger
  (Step 3). If the target is a minor bump but PATCH is not `0` (e.g.
  `0.3.3` → `0.4.2`), additionally flag that new minors normally start at
  `.0`.

- **Major bump** = MAJOR increased, e.g. `0.3.3` → `1.0.0`. ALWAYS warn with
  strong language and require explicit confirmation: this is a **major
  release**, the rarest and most consequential bump, and it produces a new
  `:<major>` image tag. If MINOR or PATCH is not `0` (e.g. `1.2.0`),
  additionally flag that major releases normally start at `X.0.0`.

When warning, always show the three "expected next" successors from the
current version so the user can see what they may have meant:
next patch (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH+1`), next minor (`MAJOR.MINOR+1.0`),
next major (`MAJOR+1.0.0`).

Do not proceed on any warned tier without a clear affirmative ("yes",
"confirmed", etc.) in the chat. If the user declines, STOP.

### 0c — Remaining setup

4. Determine whether this is a **new minor/major** (MINOR or MAJOR differs from
   current) or a **patch within the current minor**. This decides whether the
   archive trigger fires (Step 3): minor and major bumps archive **every closed
   minor series** still in the active file; patch bumps archive nothing.
5. Capture today's date as `YYYY-MM-DD` for the changelog header.

## Step 1 — Bump the version

Update `octoprint_filamentdb/_version.py` so the literal `__version__ = "<current>"` reflects
`$ARGUMENTS`. This is the single source of truth — CI and the in-app version
display both read from it. Do not touch helper functions or surrounding code.

## Step 2 — Roll the changelog

In `CHANGELOG.md`:

1. Change the `## [Unreleased]` header to `## [$ARGUMENTS] — <today>`.
2. Insert a fresh empty `## [Unreleased]` block (matching whatever HTML-comment
   skeleton the file already uses) directly above the new version header.
3. Leave the rolled section's entries exactly as written by the dev work — do
   not rewrite them, but DO sanity-check that every entry is user-facing prose
   and sits under a correct category heading (Added / Changed / Fixed /
   Security / Deprecated / Removed). Fix obvious miscategorisation only.
4. If the `[Unreleased]` section is empty (no entries to ship), STOP and
   report — there is nothing to release.

## Step 3 — Per-minor archive trigger (MINOR/MAJOR ONLY — summarize-on-archive)

Run this step only when Step 0 determined this is a **new minor (`0.x.0`) or
major (`x.0.0`) bump**. For a **patch release** (e.g. `0.3.6`), do NOT archive
anything — skip this step entirely.

Archive **every closed minor series** still living in the active `CHANGELOG.md`
(every series whose MINOR is below the new current minor), not just the
immediately-prior one — this clears any deferred backlog in one pass. For each
such closed series `<minor>.x`:

1. **Move the full detail to the archive.** Move the entire series (all its
   `## [<minor>.PATCH] — <date>` blocks, full content) out of `CHANGELOG.md` into
   `docs/CHANGELOG-<minor>.x.md`, newest-first, matching the
   format of any existing archive file. Full Keep-a-Changelog detail is preserved
   here.
2. **Leave a summary in the active file.** In place of each moved version, write a
   condensed summary block:
   - Heading: `## [<version>] — <date> (summary)`.
   - Body: **one bullet per major feature or fix.** Use judgment to **drop
     small/trivial entries** (typo fixes, copy tweaks, minor internal cleanups);
     keep user-visible features and significant fixes. Phrase each as a tight
     one-liner.
   - End the block with a deep link to the full archived section, e.g.
     `[Full notes →](docs/CHANGELOG-<minor>.x.md#<anchor>)`
     (anchor = the GitHub-style slug of the full header, e.g. `031--2026-06-21`).
3. Prepend a link to each new archive file in the "Archived releases" index at the
   bottom of `CHANGELOG.md` (create the index if absent).
4. Confirm the active `CHANGELOG.md` now holds `[Unreleased]` + the **current**
   minor series in **full detail** + each older minor as a **summary block** (with
   archive deep links).

## Step 4 — Sync the README

In `README.md`:

1. SKIP -- this project has no version badge (README carries CI/CodeQL status badges only).
   Historical step text: in `<README_BADGE_PATTERN>`, replace the current
   version with `$ARGUMENTS` (e.g. `version-<old>-gold` → `version-$ARGUMENTS-gold`).
2. Add a `### v$ARGUMENTS (<today>)` entry at the top of the
   SKIP -- CHANGELOG.md is the single source of release notes; do NOT duplicate them into the
   README. Historical step text: `<README_WHATSNEW_SECTION>` section, summarising this release in
   user-facing language drawn from the changelog entries you just rolled. Keep
   it consistent with the voice of the existing entries.
3. Update any top-of-file new-in banner / one-line status blurb to reference
   `$ARGUMENTS` if it currently names a specific version.

## Step 5 — Sync long-form docs

For each entry in `CHANGELOG.md, README.md, prompts/startnewsession.md`:

1. Apply the per-file update listed (e.g. add a row to a Revision History
   table with today's date and a one-line summary drawn from the changelog;
   update any "(planned)" or version-tagged annotations to
   "($ARGUMENTS — shipped)").
2. Do not invent new sections — only adjust version-referencing content that
   already exists.

## Step 6 — Validate locally BEFORE committing

Run the same checks CI will run, so a red PR is caught now. The minimum
matrix is `ruff check + ruff format --check + pytest + python -m build && twine check dist/* + docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml config --quiet`; run each in order. If ANY check fails, STOP,
report exactly what failed, and do not commit.

Also grep for version-string drift: confirm no stale `<old-version>`
references remain in `README.md`, `octoprint_filamentdb/_version.py`, or any file listed in
`CHANGELOG.md, README.md, prompts/startnewsession.md`. Report any other occurrences you find rather than blindly
editing.

## Step 7 — Commit

Stage everything and make ONE commit. Use a conventional-commit subject and a
body that lists what changed. Template:

```
chore(release): prepare v$ARGUMENTS

- octoprint_filamentdb/_version.py bumped to $ARGUMENTS
- CHANGELOG: rolled [Unreleased] → [$ARGUMENTS] — <today>
- README: version badge + What's New entry
- <one line per doc in DOCS_TO_SYNC>
<- archive line ONLY if a new-minor archive was performed>
```

No `Co-authored-by` lines.

## Step 8 — Push and open the PR

1. `git push origin dev`.
2. Open a PR `dev` → `main` with `gh pr create`:
   - Title: `Release v$ARGUMENTS`
   - Body: this release's CHANGELOG section (the `[$ARGUMENTS]` block you just
     rolled), so the PR description is the release notes. This is the same
     text `/release-cut` will use as the GitHub release body — single source
     of truth.
3. Capture the PR URL.

## Step 9 — Report and STOP

Print a short summary:

- The PR URL.
- Confirmation that local validation passed.
- The exact next steps for the human, verbatim:
  1. Review the PR on GitHub and wait for CI to go green.
  2. Merge the PR into `main`.
  3. Wait for the push-to-`main` build to publish `:latest` to the registry.
  4. Run `/release-cut $ARGUMENTS` to tag and publish the GitHub release.

Do NOT proceed past this point. Do not merge. Do not tag.
